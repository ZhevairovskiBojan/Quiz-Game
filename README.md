Step-by-Step Guide for Building a Quiz Game
1. HTML Structure
Let's start with the basic HTML structure for the quiz. We'll create a question section, answer options, and a button to submit the answer. Additionally, we'll include a way to display the final score.
2. CSS Styling
Next, let’s add some basic styles to make the quiz look clean.

3. JavaScript for Quiz Logic
Finally, let’s add the JavaScript for the quiz game. This part will handle:

Displaying the questions.
Handling user input (selecting answers).
Checking if the selected answer is correct or wrong.
Moving to the next question.
Showing the final score.

4. Explanation of the JavaScript Code
Questions array: This stores the questions and possible answers. Each question has an array of answers, where one or more can be marked as correct.

startQuiz(): This function resets the quiz when it starts and shows the first question.

showQuestion(): Displays the current question and the answer options as buttons. The answer options are generated dynamically from the questions array.

selectAnswer(): This function checks if the selected answer is correct, highlights the correct/incorrect answers, and allows the user to proceed to the next question.

setStatusClass(): Adds classes to the answer buttons to indicate whether they are correct or wrong (these classes change the background color).

nextButton.addEventListener(): Moves to the next question when the "Next" button is clicked, or shows the final score when the quiz is finished.

showScore(): Displays the final score once all questions have been answered.

5. Run the Quiz
Now, you can open your index.html in the browser, and you should see a functioning multiple-choice quiz. Here's what you can do:

The player selects an answer.
The correct and incorrect answers are highlighted.
After each question, the player can move to the next question.
Once all questions are answered, the final score is displayed.
6. Extensions
You can extend this project by:

Adding more questions.
Allowing multiple correct answers.
Adding a timer to each question.
Keeping track of the best score using local storage.
This is a great way to get familiar with JavaScript, especially handling DOM elements and game logic! Let me know if you have any questions or want to add more features!
